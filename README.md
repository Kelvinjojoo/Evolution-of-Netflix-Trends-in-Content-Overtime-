# ðŸ“º Evolution of Netflix: Trends in Content Over Time

Welcome to my personal data visualization project exploring the evolution of Netflix content across time, regions, and genres.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

In this project, I designed and built an interactive dashboard using **Tableau** to explore and communicate insights about Netflixâ€™s vast and ever-evolving content library. This includes analysis of TV shows and movies over the years, with key metrics such as:

- Average duration of TV Shows and Movies
- Top Actor and Director based on filters
- Content breakdown: Movies vs TV Shows
- Top 5 genres over time
- Yearly content release percentage by type
- Geographical distribution of Netflix content
- Content rating distribution

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

This project was a valuable opportunity to:

- Practice **creative thinking** in presenting complex data visually.
- Apply a **user-centered design** mindset to make dashboards intuitive and friendly for non-technical audiences.
- Enhance my **public speaking and communication skills** through direct presentation to viewers.

## ðŸ“Œ Tools Used

- **Tableau**: For interactive data visualization
- **Excel / CSV**: For preprocessing Netflix content data
- **GitHub**: To version control and share this project
